;A.S1.P1.1
;Name: Spark Artifact Edits

;Spark Artifact Edits require a simple majority of SPK holders in
;a weekly SPK Snapshot poll with a minimum quorum of 10% of circulating
;token supply. To propose a Spark Artifact Edit, an SPK holder must have
;at least 1% of the circulating token supply.
;When a proposal is made the Operational Facilitator must determine its
;alignment, and if it is considered in alignment with the Atlas and
;Spark Artifact, the edit proposal is put to a snapshot poll.
;If the poll is successful, the Facilitator must instruct the operational
;govops to carry out the artifact update.
