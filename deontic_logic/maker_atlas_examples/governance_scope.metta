;2.6.5.1.2
;If FacilitatorDAOs fail to take action against misaligned AD,
;they must be severely penalized.

;Aligned Delegate (AD)
;Aligned Delegates are Anonymous Alignment Conservers that
;use the Protocol Delegation System
;to enable regular MKR holders to easily
;and safely delegate their MKR voting power
;towards implementing the Aligned Governance Strategy of an AVC,
;while earning Governance Participation Rewards in the process.

;2.6.5.1
;If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act
;or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD
;and confiscate their AD Buffer.
;The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case
;an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information or evidence
;that led to the derecognition of the AD.
;GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of
;the whistleblower bounty.
